## Pulling Public Macroeconomic Datapoints via API Keys to Screen for potential Private Investments

<p>Extract EIA Data for US SouthEastern States' Residential Electricity Usage for initial screen of private Convenience Store (C-Store) Consolidation Opportunities

<p>(The entire Code block is higher up on this GitHub web page "Code_Macro..." or here: [https://github.com/jmenacho1/Private_Investment_Macro_Screening/blob/main/Code_Macro_Screening_Electricity.ipynb].)

<p>In the US, of the ~120k gas stations, 70% are run by a family that owns five or less units.  Extremely fragmented.
<p>A good portion of gas stations in the SouthEast US are largely family-run and are prime for consolidation where Ebitda accretion can be realized.
<p>A strict service station has an Ebitda of 4-5X. Convenience stores have Ebitda's of 10-12X.
<p>Synergies can be realized by: introduction of technology (i.e. cashless transactions), inventory and supply chain optimization, and loyalty programs.
<p>Best opportunities are regions where population is growing (i.e. electricity demand).
